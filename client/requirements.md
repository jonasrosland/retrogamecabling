## Packages
reactflow | The core diagramming library
framer-motion | For smooth UI transitions and panel animations
clsx | Utility for conditional class names (often paired with tailwind-merge)
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes safely

## Notes
The app uses a layout with a fixed sidebar and a flexible canvas area.
ReactFlow handles the node/edge rendering.
We need to handle Drag and Drop HTML5 API events to move items from Sidebar to Canvas.
Custom font 'Oxanium' is used for that retro-tech feel.
